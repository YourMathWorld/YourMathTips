    <h1>Your Maths:</h1>
   <h1> Hello I am TheMathWorldNow and today I will be teaching you how to do find area and Perimetre of any shape and I will give you some math words, lets start!!!!</h1>
   <H1>↓</H1>

    <H1>Circumference of Circle:</H1>
    <H1>To find the circumference of a circle you need to multiply the number 6.28 by the radius which will be given to you.</H1>
    <H1>Area of circle:</H1>
    <H1>To find the area of a circle you need to square the radius and multiply it by 6.28</H1>
    <H1>Normal Area:</H1>
    <H1>To find the area of any shape except for a circle is to multiply the width and lenght For instance if  the width of a rectangle was 8 and the height was 10 you would do 8 X 10 = 80 which means 80 is the answer but for triangles, you multiply but then divide by 2 or multiply by 0.5
    </H1>
    <H1>Perimetre:</H1>
    <H1>For a perimeter of any shape, you add the all of the numbers or if the shape is a quadrilateral you can also multiply the length by 2 and the width by two and then add it to get your answer</H1>
    <H1>Meaning of some math words</H1>
    <H1>Quadrilateral - Any shape with 4 sides. 
        Equilateral - Equal.   

        Obtuse angle - Higher than 90° but lower than 180°.   

        Acute angle = Lower than 90°.   

        Right angle - Exactly 90°.   

        Reflex angle - Greater than 180°.   

        Straight angle - 180° exactly.   

        Full Rotation - 360° exactly.</H1>
